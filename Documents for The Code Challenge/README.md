### Objective

Using SwiftUI, your challenge is to build out a single page iOS app for URL shortening, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs), and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

URL shortening is a technique on the Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect that links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" can be shortened to "https://example.com/Foo", and the URL "http://example.com/about/index.html" can be shortened to "https://goo.gl/aO3Ssc ".

Your challenge is to build a native iOS app using SwiftUI, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs) and get it looking as close to the design as possible. There are plenty of libraries and dependencies availble, feel free to use them. If you need to add a dependency, it is required to use Swift Package Manager.

The assignment should take around 4-6 hours ideally but you can spend time as much as you need, we don't evaluate the time.

Your users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the mobile app depending on their device's screen size
-   Shorten any valid URL
-   See a list of their shortened links ("Link History"). Link History should be persisted ideally.
-   Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
-   Delete a shortened link from their Link History
-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   The `input` field is empty

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.
See the designs in Figma here: https://bit.ly/330dJxN
See the designs as a video here: https://bit.ly/3sj8BAJ

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. The designs are in SVG format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   Using **Swift** best practices. 
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the code adequately tested?

### Deliverables

-  Write a README file to demonstrate choices and technical decision you made. Mention target platform version and any setup necessary to build the application.
-  Make sure to include all source code in the repository.
-  We recommend using latest tools which are stable(currently Xcode ~12.5. Do NOT use any beta versions. Make sure that your solution works fine before submitting and it will not take a lot of time for our team to build and run your code. If it takes a lot of time to setup and run the code, we ll reject the solution.

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
